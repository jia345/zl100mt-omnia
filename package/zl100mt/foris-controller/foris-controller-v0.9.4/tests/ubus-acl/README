Due to ubusd the tests containing ubus need to be run under root.

There are two ways how to avoid it.

1)
All files *.json needs to have root as owner and 0644 mode.
And you might need to change the user to something more appropriate.

2)
You may patch ubus with following patch and and reinstall it.
(ubus patched in the following way should not be used in production)
